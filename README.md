# SLT Usage Meter

A simple app to check your SLT package's usage. I wanted something easier to view my usage and therefore I did some reverse engineering on official 'SLT' app and made this app.

## How to use

You can either build it yourself or download from releases.

I built this for my own purpose therefore I only needed few options. There's no extra or addon data usage in this app.
